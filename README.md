# UNO

I'm currently recreating the UNO game on the web to play with friends online while learning how to program. It's been a fun project where I'm exploring various aspects of web development and game logic. The game includes features like real-time multiplayer with turn-based mechanics.

If anyone is interested in helping improve the game, whether it's by adding new features, refining the design, or fixing bugs, you're more than welcome to join the project! It's a great opportunity to collaborate, learn together, and make the game even better. Let me know if you'd like to contribute!
